## Meteoroids
Meteoroids are objects in space that range in size from dust grains to small asteroids. Think of them as “space rocks."

## Meteors
When meteoroids enter Earth’s atmosphere (or that of another planet, like Mars) at high speed and burn up, the fireballs or “shooting stars” are called meteors.

## Meteorite
When a meteoroid survives a trip through the atmosphere and hits the ground, it’s called a meteorite.
